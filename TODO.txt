A study has subjects.
Subjects have sessions
sessions have MRI data {anat,func,fmap,dwi}
MRI data folders have data.


Part 1: Create File structure
- This will create a study with subjects with sub-folders

So, input would be:
			- The study directory name
			- Subject ID OR List of subjects
			- number of sessions
				- if single subject ID provided, then create it
				- if list of subjects, then create it
- checks:
	- directory exists
	- does that subject already exist?
