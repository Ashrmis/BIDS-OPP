# Generating a new SSH key
1. ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
2. Copy the .pub to github 

# might just have to do the below stuff
3. eval `ssh-agent -s`
4. ssh-add {key that was generated. Not the .pub one}

--------------------------------------------------------


# creating a new git repo
git init
touch README.md
git add README.md
git commit -m "Adding a file"
# go to github and create an empty repo and get the sshkey from there
git remote add origin {insert key here}
git remote -v
git push origin master

git fetch origin master <-- checks to see if there are any new changes on the github/remote repository
git pull origin master  <-- pulls from github/remote repository

# Branches
git branch <-- see any new branches
git checkout -b {name of new branch} <- this will also automatically switch you to the new branch

git checkout {name of branch} <-- change between branches

#once you have made your edits on the branches
git add
git commit -m

git diff {branch1} {branch2} <-- shows the difference between branches

git push origin {branch-name}

# then on Github you can see the changes and create a pull request,
# once they are merged on Github, you can do:
	git checkout master
	git pull origin master
	
# Undoing in Github
# unstage fomr a commit
git reset
git reset {name of file to unstage from a commit}

git reset HEAD~1 <-- unstages changes from 1 commit ago, not the one that was just comitted

git restore {name of file} to discard changes made to a file
